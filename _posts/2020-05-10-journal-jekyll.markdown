# Decision
> I was in my wife’s home today morning because 8, May is parent’s day.
The father-in-law was still ignorant and obstinate.
He’s sucks. And His son too.
Actually that all family is suck.
Don’t let thought deep.
It is not matter and not good for me.
Just run. Tyrese.  It’s time to go.

Father-in-law 장인어른
Obstinate 압스트넷 완고한, 난감한.
