# Decision
> Iâ€™ve thought about this a lot.       
I think this is super matter because my life is just slipping away.     
I am already 43 years old.      
Finally I have decided where i write my journal.      
No more thinking.      
This place is not only for journal.      
My feeling and anything is writable to this place.     
I think I can do it still.     
Okay just do it. Go for it Tyrese.
