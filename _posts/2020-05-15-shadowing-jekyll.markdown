# it took me probably about a year

```
One of biggest chanllenges for me becoming a researcher is that, 
my first language is spanish.
It was really really challenging at first.
you know, trying to write in Enlish, the whole time,
try to communicate in English the whole time.
trying to receive classes in English the whole time.
And it took me probably about a year.
utli like I was really comportable and it was not an exhaustive process.
Like I would be, I would be literally exhausted by the end of the day.
There's many tasks that you have to do at gived time.
A lot of people don't think that they have to write really well.
but when you're a scientist, you're gonna spend a lot of time writing.
