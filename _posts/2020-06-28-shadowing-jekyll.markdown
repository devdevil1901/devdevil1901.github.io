# [Powerful Ancient Sanctuary Found in Greece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaAQqUdvEdo)   
 Delphi, Greece.   
 Near the **Gulf** of Corinth, on the **slopes** of Mount Parnassus,    
 a religious **shrine**, known as the Sanctuary of Apollo, was established sometime before 1200 BC.      
 It was here that the legendary Oracle of Delphi, a **succession** of priestesses of Apollo, **prophesied** for the people of Greece.    
 According to the Greek author Plutarch, the Oracle would enter a small chamber in the Temple of Apollo, take her seat on a tripod,
 and **inhale** sweet-smelling vapors, inducing a trance-like state from which she could communicate with the gods.
