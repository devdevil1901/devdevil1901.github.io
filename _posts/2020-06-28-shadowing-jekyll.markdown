# [Powerful Ancient Sanctuary Found in Greece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaAQqUdvEdo)   
Delphi, Greece.   
Near the **Gulf** of Corinth, on the **slopes** of Mount Parnassus,    
a religious **shrine**, known as the Sanctuary of Apollo, was established sometime before 1200 BC.      
It was here that the legendary Oracle of Delphi, a **succession** of priestesses of Apollo, **prophesied** for the people of Greece.    
According to the Greek author Plutarch, the Oracle would enter a small chamber in the Temple of Apollo, take her seat on a tripod,
and **inhale** sweet-smelling vapors, inducing a **trance**-like state from which she could communicate with the gods.       
It was the seat of Apollo's oracle, so he was the one who provided prophecies there.   
The **priestess** is there just as a **conduit** for it.
In fact, she has no power of her own.   
So Apollo himself is not going to **show up** to actually deliver the oracles.   
He's on Mount Olympus.   
He's with the other Olympian gods.    
His line is open for questions, but he's not going to **show up** himself.  
Lots of people came to visit looking for answers to questions that they had.   
And these are people not only in mythology, but, in fact, actual people in history coming to visit.    
If you go to Delphi today, you can see **inscriptions** of the answers that were given to questions.   
Although the Oracle made her final prophecy over 1600 years ago, for many, the Sanctuary of Apollo remains an important site   
because of the relics and offerings that may still lie there to this day.   

But some believe that among these riches lies a much more **profound** treasure an omphalos stone.   
In Greek, the word omphalos literally translates to navel.   
And while there were numerous omphalos stones **throughout** Greece, the egg-shaped omphalos stone at Delphi was the most significant.      
This navel really just represents sort of the center of the Earth.   
Now, not the center of what we think of as the Earth,   
but the center as in the most important place for the Olympian gods.    
One story is that Zeus sent some birds flying in different directions, and where they met was the omphalos.   
That was the navel of the Earth.    
This is where this oracle would be established.    

But **in addition to** marking the center of the Earth for the Olympians, in some ancient Greek accounts,   
the omphalos stone was also the source of her **prognostications**.   
But sometimes the omphalos stone **exerts** some power.    
Sometimes it's just a **vessel** for **gaseous** **fumes** that get you high and puts you in the right **mindset** to talk to the gods.    
Sometimes it's just a stone.    
If true communication took place between our world and extraterrestrials, which the ancient Greek gods were,    
then I **prefer to** think that some type of transmitter was used and only the Oracle knew how to operate it.    
Why?   
Because she was the chosen one.
