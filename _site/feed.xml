&lt;p&gt;comment: &lt;br /&gt;
Why did Trump congratulate himself after 40k people died? &lt;br /&gt;
Let him explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump: &lt;br /&gt;
like yeah here we go&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNN Reporter:(00:08) &lt;br /&gt;
Mr. president. 22 more than 22 million Americans are currently unemployed yeah as a result of this. &lt;br /&gt;
today we &lt;strong&gt;hit the grim milestone&lt;/strong&gt; of more than 40,000 Americans now having died from the corona virus. &lt;br /&gt;
can you explain then why you come out here and you were reading clips and  &lt;br /&gt;
and and showing clips of praise for you and for your administration. &lt;br /&gt;
is this really the time for self-congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;   
40000명의 사람들이 죽은후 왜 트럼프는 자축을 하는가? 그에서 설명을 들어보자.   

시작해 볼까요?

대통령님. 22만 명의 미국인이 현재 실직 상태입니다. 이것의 결과로요.

오늘 우리는 4만명이상의 미국인이 코로나 바이러스로 죽어가고 있는 암울한 이정표를 남겼습니다.
왜 여기나와서 당신과 당신 정부를 칭찬하는 clip을 읽고 보여주는 것입니까?
정말 자축할 시간이 맞나요?   
     
grim  [ɡrɪm] 엄숙한, 암울한, 음침한&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;praise [preɪz] 칭찬,찬양 &lt;br /&gt;
40,000 forty thousand&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/h6&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump:(00:33) &lt;br /&gt;
well I will tell you this what I’m doing is I’m standing up for the men and women. &lt;br /&gt;
that have done such an incredible job not for me.  &lt;br /&gt;
and for the men and women   ,
Admirals, vice president  &lt;br /&gt;
if I might &lt;br /&gt;
but all of the men and women thousands tens of thousands of them that built hospitals in New York and New Jersey 
and all over this country &lt;strong&gt;in record time&lt;/strong&gt; that throw up a thousand beds in four days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
음..나는 나를 위해서가 아니라, 그런 놀라운 것을 해낸 사람들을 위해 서있는 것이 내가 하는 일입니다.
남성들 여성들, 해군제독,부통령을 위해.   
만약 아마도   
뉴욕과 뉴저지에서 모두가 많은 사람들이죠 그들이 병원을 지었습니다.   
이 나라 곳곳에4일만에 천개의 침상이 버려지는 기록적인 시간들속에서요.   

I will tell you this what은 you know what 정도의 의미인듯.
admiral [ˈædmərəl] 해군장성
vice president 부통령
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sticking up for those people those people have been incredible .  &lt;br /&gt;
I’m also sticking up for doctors and nurses and military doctors &lt;br /&gt;
New Reporter: (01:08) &lt;br /&gt;
But the clips that you played and what you read earlier was praising you and your administration specifically. &lt;br /&gt;
Trump(01:12):  &lt;br /&gt;
All I played today was Governor Cuomo. &lt;br /&gt;
New Reporter:(1:12) &lt;br /&gt;
Why is now the moment to do that, sir? &lt;br /&gt;
Trump(1:13) &lt;br /&gt;
saying very positive things about the job the federal government has done, and those people &lt;br /&gt;
News Rerpoter: &lt;br /&gt;
On the day where more that 40,000 Americans have now died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;
난 그런 대단한 일을 해낸 사람들을 지지 합니다.  
난 또한 의사들 간호사들 군 의사들을 지지합니다. 
그렇지만 당신이 앞서 보여준 clip과 읽은 것들은 당신과 당신의 정부를 찬양하는 것들이었습니다.   
나는 오늘 Cuomo 주지사를 플레이한게 다에요.    
왜 지금 순간에 한거죠?   
연방 정부가 한 긍정적인 것들에 대해 말하는 것은, 그리고 그런 사람들    
4만명 넘는 사람들이 지금 죽어가는 날에요.
&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump:
and those people have been just absolutely excoriated by some of the fake news, &lt;br /&gt;
like you, you CNN your fake news  &lt;br /&gt;
and let me just tell you they were excoriated by people like you that don’t know any better  &lt;br /&gt;
because you don’t have the brains you were born with you should be praising the people that have done a good job, &lt;br /&gt;
not doing what you do even that question so just so you understand if we didn’t do a job
News Reporter:
The question is: ‘Why now, sir?’
The question is: ‘Why now’ not ‘why are you doing it’ but why now? &lt;br /&gt;
Trump: &lt;br /&gt;
I’ll tell you why now. &lt;br /&gt;
you’re ready? &lt;br /&gt;
because these people are right now in hospitals &lt;br /&gt;
it’s dangerous it’s going to a battlefield  &lt;br /&gt;
and I want these people I want you I want you &lt;br /&gt;
Rerporter: &lt;br /&gt;
This wasn’t about hospital workers, sir.
Trump:  &lt;br /&gt;
I want you and &lt;br /&gt;
Reporter: &lt;br /&gt;
This wasn’t about the doctors. &lt;br /&gt;
Trump:
It’s all about that. &lt;br /&gt;
Reporter: &lt;br /&gt;
This was about you and your administration &lt;br /&gt;
Trmp:
It’s not about me. no, &lt;strong&gt;nothing is about me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;
excoriate [eksˈkɔːrieɪt] 상처를 입히다, 마구비난하다.
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump:(1:59)
look look you’re never gonna treat me fairly many of you &lt;br /&gt;
and I understand that I don’t even know &lt;br /&gt;
I got here with the worst &lt;br /&gt;
most unfair press treatment they say in the history of the United States for president  &lt;br /&gt;
they did say Abraham Lincoln had very bad treatment too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tyrese Ahn</name><email>thevampir2lestat@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">Today shadowing.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LiveData with Coroutines and Flow</title><link href="http://devdevil1901.github.io/jekyll/update/English-Study-Shadowing-livedata-with-coroutines-jekyll/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LiveData with Coroutines and Flow" /><published>2020-04-25T12:38:33+09:00</published><updated>2020-04-25T12:38:33+09:00</updated><id>http://devdevil1901.github.io/jekyll/update/English-Study-Shadowing-livedata-with-coroutines-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://devdevil1901.github.io/jekyll/update/English-Study-Shadowing-livedata-with-coroutines-jekyll/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ppnjGPAGE&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hi there.   
My name is Jose Alcerreca. I'm developer relations engineer working on Android.   
My name is Yigit Boyar. I also work on the Android team.   
Today we're going to talk about LiveData again.   
We were here last year with a talk titled fun with LiveData.   
Today we're going to talk about its integration with coroutines and with Flow.   

So since API we've struggled to understand Android lifecycles.   
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;안녕하세요 제이름은 호세 알세레카이고요, 안드로이드에서 일하는 엔지니어관련 개발자 입니다.   
&lt;h6&gt;저는 이짓 보얄이고요, 저또한 안드로이드 팀에서 일하고 있어요.   
&lt;h6&gt;오늘 우리는 다시 LiveData에 대해서 얘기할 거에요.   
&lt;h6&gt;우리는 여기서, 지난해에 fun with LiveData란 제목으로 이야기 했었죠.  
&lt;h6&gt;오늘은 우리는 코루틴과 플로우와 함께 그것의 통합에 대해 말하려고 합니다.   
&lt;h6&gt;API 이래로 우리는 안드로이드 라이프 사이클을 이해하기 위해 노력해 왔습니&lt;/h6&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
