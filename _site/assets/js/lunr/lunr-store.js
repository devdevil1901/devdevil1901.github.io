You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.   Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:   YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP   Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.   Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:   def print_hi(name)   puts \"Hi, #{name}\" end print_hi('Tom') #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.  Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.

Trump:   like yeah here we go   CNN Reporter:(00:08)   Mr. president. 22 more than 22 million Americans are currently unemployed yeah as a result of this.   today we hit the grim milestone of more than 40,000 Americans now having died from the corona virus.   can you explain then why you come out here and you were reading clips and    and and showing clips of praise for you and for your administration.   is this really the time for self-congratulations.       40000명의 사람들이 죽은후 왜 트럼프는 자축을 하는가? 그에서 설명을 들어보자.     시작해 볼까요?  대통령님. 22만 명의 미국인이 현재 실직 상태입니다. 이것의 결과로요.  오늘 우리는 4만명이상의 미국인이 코로나 바이러스로 죽어가고 있는 암울한 이정표를 남겼습니다. 왜 여기나와서 당신과 당신 정부를 칭찬하는 clip을 읽고 보여주는 것입니까? 정말 자축할 시간이 맞나요?          grim  [ɡrɪm] 엄숙한, 암울한, 음침한  praise [preɪz] 칭찬,찬양   40,000 forty thousand  &lt;/h6&gt;   Trump:(00:33)   well I will tell you this what I’m doing is I’m standing up for the men and women.   that have done such an incredible job not for me.    and for the men and women   , Admirals, vice president    if I might   but all of the men and women thousands tens of thousands of them that built hospitals in New York and New Jersey  and all over this country in record time that throw up a thousand beds in four days.    음..나는 나를 위해서가 아니라, 그런 놀라운 것을 해낸 사람들을 위해 서있는 것이 내가 하는 일입니다. 남성들 여성들, 해군제독,부통령을 위해.    만약 아마도    뉴욕과 뉴저지에서 모두가 많은 사람들이죠 그들이 병원을 지었습니다.    이 나라 곳곳에4일만에 천개의 침상이 버려지는 기록적인 시간들속에서요.     I will tell you this what은 you know what 정도의 의미인듯. admiral [ˈædmərəl] 해군장성 vice president 부통령    I’m sticking up for those people those people have been incredible .    I’m also sticking up for doctors and nurses and military doctors   New Reporter: (01:08)   But the clips that you played and what you read earlier was praising you and your administration specifically.   Trump(01:12):    All I played today was Governor Cuomo.   New Reporter:(1:12)   Why is now the moment to do that, sir?   Trump(1:13)   saying very positive things about the job the federal government has done, and those people   News Rerpoter:   On the day where more that 40,000 Americans have now died.   난 그런 대단한 일을 해낸 사람들을 지지 합니다.   난 또한 의사들 간호사들 군 의사들을 지지합니다.  그렇지만 당신이 앞서 보여준 clip과 읽은 것들은 당신과 당신의 정부를 찬양하는 것들이었습니다.    나는 오늘 Cuomo 주지사를 플레이한게 다에요.     왜 지금 순간에 한거죠?    연방 정부가 한 긍정적인 것들에 대해 말하는 것은, 그리고 그런 사람들     4만명 넘는 사람들이 지금 죽어가는 날에요.   Trump: and those people have been just absolutely excoriated by some of the fake news,   like you, you CNN your fake news    and let me just tell you they were excoriated by people like you that don’t know any better    because you don’t have the brains you were born with you should be praising the people that have done a good job,   not doing what you do even that question so just so you understand if we didn’t do a job News Reporter: The question is: ‘Why now, sir?’ The question is: ‘Why now’ not ‘why are you doing it’ but why now?   Trump:   I’ll tell you why now.   you’re ready?   because these people are right now in hospitals   it’s dangerous it’s going to a battlefield    and I want these people I want you I want you   Rerporter:   This wasn’t about hospital workers, sir. Trump:    I want you and   Reporter:   This wasn’t about the doctors.   Trump: It’s all about that.   Reporter:   This was about you and your administration   Trmp: It’s not about me. no, nothing is about me   excoriate [eksˈkɔːrieɪt] 상처를 입히다, 마구비난하다.    Trump:(1:59) look look you’re never gonna treat me fairly many of you   and I understand that I don’t even know   I got here with the worst   most unfair press treatment they say in the history of the United States for president    they did say Abraham Lincoln had very bad treatment too.
